 * Total Submissions: 2.1M
 * Testcase Example:  '[10,15,20]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of i^th step
 * on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two
 * steps.
 *
 * You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: cost = [10,15,20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: You will start at index 1.
 * - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
 * The total cost is 15.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: You will start at index 0.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
 * - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
 * - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
 * - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
 * The total cost is 6.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= cost[i] <= 999
